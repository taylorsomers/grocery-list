# Grocery List Organizer

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

  A website displaying what I have learned with regard to using arrays and loops to collect, organize, format, and display data from users. To illustrate the principles involved, I've followed the instruction received from Epicodus to create a website that collects items to be added to a grocery list and capitalizes the first letter of each item as well as displaying them in an alphabetized ordered list.
